# Poshmark Data Pull
Pulls data from Poshmark to build a price recommendation tool for Poshmark sellers. The Poshmark website loads HTML values from a json response, the code in posh_data_pull.py pulls the data by creating a request for the parameters listed in the code and stores it into a text file.
